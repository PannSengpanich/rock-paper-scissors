The Rock Paper Scissors project is a web development project included in The Odin Project curriculum. It is a beginner-level project that involves building a browser-based version of the popular hand game, Rock Paper Scissors.

The goal of the project is to apply the knowledge gained in earlier lessons of the course, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create a fully-functional game that allows users to play against the computer. The Rock Paper Scissors project requires the use of event listeners, DOM manipulation, and JavaScript functions to create a dynamic user interface that responds to user input and generates random moves for the computer.
