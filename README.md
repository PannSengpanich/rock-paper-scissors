# rock-paper-scissors
The Rock Paper Scissors project is a web development project included in The Odin Project Foundation Course. It is an introductory-level project that involves building a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors.

The goal of the project is to apply the knowledge gained in earlier lessons of the course, such as basic JavaScript programming concepts, to create a simple game that allows the user to select one of three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and then compares their selection to a randomly generated computer selection. The Rock Paper Scissors project requires the use of JavaScript to create the game's functionality and add interactivity to the web page.

The project provides an opportunity to practice working with JavaScript functions and conditionals, handling user events, and creating a basic game that can be played in the browser. It is a great exercise for beginners to get hands-on experience and build a simple interactive application.
